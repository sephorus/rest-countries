## Quick Project Description

This repository is to host the source code for my solution to the Frontend Mentor challenge [REST Countries Web App](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca)

Users should be able to

-   See all countries from the API on the homepage
-   Search for a country using an input field
-   Filter countries by region
-   Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
-   Click through to the border countries on the detail page
-   Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## Live Demo Link

The live example is hosted on GitHub pages: [link to live example](https://sephorus.github.io/rest-countries/)

## How I worked on this project

My goal was to simulate a professional work environment of a frontend developer

-   I built this app based on Figma design files: [design files found here](https://github.com/sephorus/rest-countries/tree/main/design)
-   I worked with tasks on a Kanban board: [screenshot of Kanban board](https://github.com/sephorus/rest-countries/blob/main/rest-countries-app/src/images/kanban.png)
-   I used feature branches and pull requests: [example pull request]()

## How to navigate this project

-   The application fetches data from the [Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/): Examples for the [request]() and [data transformation]()

## Why I built the project this way

-   My plan is to become a full-stack developer eventually, but for now I focused on the frontend aspect for this application. I decided to use an existing API rather than creating a custom server. I have basic backend knowledge as well.
-   I used a SASS, a CSS-preprocessor, to increase the readability of my styles, as well as making it easier for me to write nested CSS.
