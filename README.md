# FindMyCountry Web Application

## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment of a frontend developer
- I built this app based on Figma design files:
- I worked with tasks on a Kanban board: 
- I used feature branches and pull requests

## How to navigate this project
- The application fetches data from the Countries API: Examples for the request and data transformation

## Why I built the project this way
- I didn't use a state management library like Redux on purpose. For this app
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer eventually, but for now I focused on the frontend aspect for this application. I decided to use an existing API rather than creating a custom server. I have basic backend knowledge as well.
- I used a SASS, a CSS-preprocessor, to increase the readability of my styles, as well as making it easier for me to write nested CSS.
